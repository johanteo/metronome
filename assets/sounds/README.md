# Metronome Tick Sound

This directory should contain a `tick.mp3` file (or `tick.wav`) that will be used as the metronome tick sound.

## Adding the Sound File

You can:
1. Download a short metronome tick sound (around 50-100ms duration, 800Hz recommended)
2. Or generate one using an audio editor
3. Place it as `tick.mp3` or `tick.wav` in this directory

The sound should be short, clear, and suitable for a metronome - a simple "tick" or "click" sound works best.
